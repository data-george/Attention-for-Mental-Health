        "## To follow up on the previous model on detecting Covid-19 on Chest X-Rays and trying to come up with other helpful solutions to improve people's lives during these hard times, we will focus on another aspect of this Pandemic - Mental Health. The intent here is to build a question and answer transformer model to answer people's questions in  regards to mental health. Mental Health is another crucial component of overall well being and many people are likely to show symptoms or exacerbate existing symptoms during the pandemic due to periods of paranoia, extended isolation, etc. It would be helpful to have an easily accessible chatbot or question and answer model, possibly through a website interface, that can provide interactive answers to mental health questions from users. The key of this project is to show the potential of a transformer solution for this problem, for which a real solution would have to be vetted by a mental health/medical and data science teams. The project uses the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin or ArXiv.org submitted on 12 Jun 2017 (v1), last revised 6 Dec 2017, v5 to create the question and answer model. <br><br>\n",

              "\"Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.\""

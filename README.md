# Attention-for-Mental-Health
## To follow up on the previous model on detecting Covid-19 on Chest X-Rays and trying to come up with other helpful solutions to improve people's lives during these hard times, we will focus on another aspect of this Pandemic - Mental Health. The intent here is to build a question and answer transformer model to answer people's questions in  regards to mental health. Mental Health is another crucial component of overall well being and many people are likely to show symptoms or exacerbate existing symptoms during the pandemic due to periods of paranoia, extended isolation, etc. It would be helpful to have an easily accessible chatbot or question and answer model, possibly through a website interface, that can provide interactive answers to mental health questions from users. The key of this project is to show the potential of a transformer solution for this problem, for which a real solution would have to be vetted by a mental health/medical and data science teams. The project uses the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin or ArXiv.org submitted on 12 Jun 2017 (v1), last revised 6 Dec 2017, v5 to create the question and answer model. &lt;br>&lt;br>
